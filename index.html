          <p>The USO has been committed to delivering entertainment to service members for over 75 years. Across the globe and for generations, this stewardship has brought excitement to service members, transporting them closer to home and country. We honor this legacy, highlight the organization’s commitment, and demonstrate the valuable connection entertainment provides America’s military and its families through an interactive experience of the universe of celebrities who have volunteered their time and talent for decades.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-3">An Immersive Archive</h2>
        <p class="intro-text">There is no better way to show the expanse and impact of USO’s entertainment than an experience that allows users to explore its impact at a high-level and dive deep into tours and celebrities. This searchable library of entertainment will feature efforts throughout time, across the planet, and encourage deep interaction.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="w-row">
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">
          <div class="content-block">
            <p>Potential entertainers, high-value donors, supporters, and service members will be able to interact through a multi-channel experience. The design will allow users to browse through entertainment efforts over time, view highlighted talent, dive into specific efforts to view photos and social media posts, and discover hidden outtakes and bloopers. At the same time, it will provide optional pathways to send a message, donate to USO’s entertainment efforts, or sign up for a tour.</p>

            <p> The initial iteration will be browser-based and focused on the public audience. Since this experience is intended to be web-based, managed by a Rails CMS, and connected to Salesforce, the shapes and boxes it can fill are endless.</p>
            <p>Some of the features highlighted below illustrate how we can draw users into the entertainment experience.</p>

            <h3>A story for every focus</h3>
            <p>The experience will have two views: an index and a map/timeline view. Both of these will have an ambient auto-play mode to encourage interaction. Once users interact with it, they will be able to zoom in to discrete entertainment event points, allowing them to see the high-level impact and then dive into the actual experience of each event or appearance.</p> <p>We’ll associate each point on the map or event tile with a set of metadata (such as date, attendance figures, all celebrities involved, etc.), a video/photo of the appearance, as well as with images and social media posts depicting candid, behind-the-scenes moments around the appearance. We’ll visually connect map points based on other places visited by the performer, as well as those traveled to by associated celebrities.

            <h3>Give the crowd who they want</h3>
            <p>We’ll single out the most well-known celebrities as case studies to show not only their impact but to demonstrate to future entertainers how they can interact with and help service members. Each of these moments can be a shareable experience to send to an agent or someone who wants to see, say, Katy Perry’s tour. In future iterations, we’ll accommodate less high-profile celebrities as well to demonstrate the breadth and depth of entertainers contributing their efforts to our service members.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-5">Development Approach</h3>
        <p class="intro-text">We feel that an iterative approach to developing USO Entertainment will set the foundation for the greatest long-term benefit. </p>
        <p>Our objective in the near-term is to think broadly about the overall structure of a USO archive site, while focusing on what we feel will yield the most high-impact, short-term results: a focus on USO’s rich entertainment history. We will orient our interface design efforts toward developing multiple interaction models (map-based, timeline-based, and relationship-based) and developing content associated with USO’s most high-profile and well-known entertainers and celebrities.</p>
        <p>Our June 30th release will be in and of itself satisfying and complete, but the investment in the infrastructure now will enable us to roll in more content from lesser-known celebrities throughout the remainder of the year.
        <p>As the entertainment aspect of the experience grows throughout 2018, we’ll begin the process of considering how best to weave in additional non-entertainment archival content to enhance the robustness of the “Wikipedia of the USO” aspect of the product. Our long-term vision is for a rich, “rabbit-hole” experience of the USO’s history.

            <h3 class="heading-4">Minimum Viable Product</h3>
            <p>We’ll begin by demonstrating the concepts you see here with greater fidelity. There is much that we don’t know about the nature and structure of USO’s underlying data on celebrities and entertainment tours, so this approach allows us a brief period of technical and content discovery, followed by concept and graphic design iteration toward a public MVP release by the end of Q2 (June 30).</p>
